# Welcome!
Do you:
1) Use a computer to time your timed practices...
2) And then you find yourself clicking on other things?
3) ...or you may have other attachment tabs open but find them distracting?

**Then this thing is for you!!**

# What does it do?
Simply put, it runs off a `.seb` configuration file - just have Safe Exam Browser installed, download the configuration file, and run it.

You can:
1) Set the desired time, or you can test it out with 30 seconds of lockdown.
2) Choose the exam attachments you want - so far I have the MF27 and the Chemistry Data Booklet installed. I can include more if you ask for it!
3) Switch between normal count-down, or use it like your classroom exam: just display the start and end times!
4) Do your timed practice with no distractions, you only see the countdown (and the attachment, if any).
5) Closed your attachment by mistake? No worries! Simply reopen it with the dedicated button.

Take note that if you wish to project onto a larger screen (especially teachers who want to use it as a timing tool), please take note that Safe Exam Browser may NOT allow dual screens.

# What does it NOT do?
If you happen to do computing examinations, I'm sorry - so far the configuration file does NOT support having other applications open. 
If you wish, you may consider having a virtual machine (locked down) and then having this open on another device.
